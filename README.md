### Key Features:

**1. Encrypts and Embeds the global-metadata.dat File**
The `global-metadata.dat` file is a critical component of Unity's IL2CPP scripting backend, containing essential metadata about your game's classes, methods, and other runtime information. Protecting this file from tampering or extraction is vital, as it can reveal your game's structure and logic. Our tool encrypts and seamlessly embeds this file into your build, making it significantly more difficult for attackers to access or analyze your game's internals. This layer of security helps prevent reverse engineering and unauthorized modifications, safeguarding your intellectual property.

**2. Obfuscates IL2CPP Classes**
Understanding IL2CPP classes is a common goal for malicious actors attempting to reverse engineer your game. Our obfuscation feature transforms class names and structures, making them obscure and unintelligible. This process complicates static and dynamic analysis, deterring attempts to understand or modify your code. By obfuscating IL2CPP classes, you enhance your project's resilience against hacking tools, intellectual property theft, and cheating mechanisms.

**3. Checks Integrity of IL2CPP Function Calls**
Tampering with function calls can compromise your game's security, leading to cheating, exploits, or unauthorized content access. Our asset implements integrity checks for all IL2CPP function calls, ensuring that any unauthorized modifications or injections are detected promptly. This real-time verification helps maintain the integrity of your game's logic, providing peace of mind that your application's core functions are protected against tampering.

### Why Is Project Security Important?

In today's digital landscape, protecting your Unity project isn't just about safeguarding your code—it's about preserving your creative work, revenue, and reputation. Unauthorized access can lead to piracy, cheating, data theft, and loss of competitive advantage. By implementing robust security measures early in your development process, you reduce the risk of malicious attacks and ensure a safer environment for your users.

Furthermore, protecting sensitive files like `global-metadata.dat` and obfuscating classes make it more challenging for hackers to dissect your game, minimizing the chances of exploits and leaks. This not only preserves your intellectual property but also enhances your project's credibility and trustworthiness.
